# Getting Started with Create React App Project 2

This is a Blog Site that I am also contributing as a Technical Writer. We are team [DataMob](https://datamobteam.blogspot.com/). we are writing Technical Things and Career Development Tips.
<br/>
I am Lerning React framework. i thought it is better to create a platform for us. because we are using [Blogger](https://datamobteam.blogspot.com/) as our platform.
<br/>
React is a new technology to me. day by day I am Getting Familiar with that framework and also i am studying NodeJS as a backend framework these days. i am Trying to develop this site as my best practise.

## Methodology

I have done the basic things of React, with my Previous project called [First-web](https://github.com/Dimuthu-10/first-web).Here I have done what create json server, fetch request and use different components to create an interactive page. You can add here new blogs and delete the blogs that you don't want. Blog update status is Ongoing.

## Tools
- React
    - Json server
    - Hooks
    - Router
- Bootstarp

## Special Note
- I am still Learning Front-end part with React here. I wish to Develop this site with NodeJS backend and APIs.
